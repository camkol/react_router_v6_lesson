## My process

- Install `react-router-dom` and add it to a React application.
- Enable routing by using `RouterProvider` and providing a `router`.
- Creating a router using `createBrowserRouter()`.
- Use `createRoutesFromElements()` to configure a router.
- Use the `Route` component to add static and dynamic routes to an application.
- Use `Link` and `NavLink` components to add links to an application.
- Access the values of URL parameters using React Router’s `useParams` hook.
- Create nested routes using `Route`, `Outlet`, and relative `path`s.
- Declaratively redirect users by rendering React Router’s `Navigate` component
- Imperatively redirect users via the `useNavigate` hook.
- Access and set the value of query parameters using React Router’s `useSearchParams` hook.
